# latex-folding

Adds header folding support for markdown files in Atom. Requires [`atom-folding`](https://github.com/Aerijo/atom-folding).

Note this will disable default folds for LaTeX files, as they interfere with certain assumtions being made. This is temporary, I just haven't gotten round to a fully robust implementation; it is theoretically possible to have default folds too.
