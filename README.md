# latex-folding
The best (and only?) folding for LaTeX in Atom.

Major changes this update, should be working as well as the inbuilt indentation based folding does (but note that has been removed; am able to make it configurable).

This package overrides core folding methods, but never modifies / deletes text. All changes are visual and will be reset if the tab is closed. Having said that, please always make a backup of your files.
