# latex-folding
Code folding for LaTeX in Atom (modelled off [`custom-folds`](https://atom.io/packages/custom-folds)).

Just finished a working version, so no guarantees for bugs, etc. Close the tab and reopen it if something goes wrong.

This package never modifies / deletes text; all changes are visual and will be reset if the tab is closed. Having said that, please always make a backup of your files.
